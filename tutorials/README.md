# Python Fundamentals Tutorials

Learn Python basics through genomics examples! Each tutorial teaches core Python concepts using DNA sequences, genes, and bioinformatics applications.

## 📚 Learning Path

Work through these tutorials in order to build a solid foundation:

### 1. Strings and DNA Sequences
**File:** `01_strings_and_dna.py`

Learn string operations using DNA sequences:
- Creating and manipulating strings
- Indexing and slicing
- String methods (upper, lower, count, find)
- String concatenation
- Checking for patterns

### 2. Lists and Sequence Collections
**File:** `02_lists_and_sequences.py`

Work with lists using multiple sequences:
- Creating and accessing lists
- Adding/removing elements
- List methods (append, insert, sort)
- List slicing
- List comprehensions

### 3. Dictionaries and the Genetic Code
**File:** `03_dictionaries_and_codons.py`

Master dictionaries with codon tables:
- Creating dictionaries
- Accessing and modifying values
- Dictionary methods
- Looping through dictionaries
- Practical applications

### 4. Conditionals in Genomics
**File:** `04_conditionals_in_genomics.py`

Use if/elif/else for sequence validation:
- Basic if statements
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Nested conditionals
- Complex decision making

### 5. Loops and Iteration
**File:** `05_loops_and_iteration.py`

Iterate through sequences and data:
- For loops
- While loops
- Loop control (break, continue)
- Nested loops
- Enumerate and zip

### 6. File I/O in Genomics
**File:** `06_file_io_genomics.py`

Read and write genomic data files:
- Opening and closing files
- Reading files (read, readline, readlines)
- Writing files
- File modes (r, w, a)
- Working with FASTA files
